# Traffic-condition-analysis
#Implemented and trained Generative Adversarial Networks for night-to-day road image translation
#Evaluated multiple GAN models, including CycleGAN and Pix2PixGAN, to determine optimal performance
#Enhanced traffic classification performance by fine-tuning a CNN, increasing accuracy from 51% to 75%
#Trained an Adaptive GAN to handle diverse traffic conditions, improving model adaptability and performance
